I decided to put the resources I usually use to help resolve issues related to sample size calculation in one place so that I can find them easily and share with others! That was the motivation to start this but now I am trying trying to covert it to a standalone site to help others to calculate sample size for their project. I hope you find this useful. Feedback & suggestions welcome via email.
