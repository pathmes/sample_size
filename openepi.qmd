The best way to learn sample size calculation is by doing. We can find the required sample size for a study by calculating using an appropriate formula or computer software, looking up the numbers in published tables of sample sizes, or using a web based sample size calculator. A web based calculator makes the task relatively easy and quick provided one knows how to use it. In this section we'll practice sample size calculations for some common situations using OpenEpi.

## OpenEpi

OpenEpi is a free and open-source software for epidemiologic statistics. It can be accessed at the [OpenEpi website](https://www.openepi.com/Menu/OE_Menu.htm){target="_blank"} or downloaded and run without a web connection. A server is not required. The programs can be run in the browsers of many iPhone and Android cell phones and tablets. Explore the website and become familiar with the different features available.\
The main ideas behind the calculation of sample size for different study designs will be presented as a hypothetical conversation between a researcher and a statistician. This will be followed by instructions on how to use OpenEpi to calculate the sample size in a particular situation.

## Sample size for a descriptive study

We use descriptive studies to determine the prevalence of a health condition (diabetes, hypertension, hearing impairment, cerebral palsy, etc.) or health related behaviour (level of physical activity, smoking, participating in health screening, etc.).

**Researcher:** I plan to do a cross-sectional study to determine smoking prevalence among adult men living in a Divisional Secretary area. Please tell me the sample size that will provide useful results. I know the results won't be useful if the sample size is too small, and I don't want to waste resources by collecting an unnecessarily large sample.

**Statistician:** The required sample size depends on several factors, but first, we'll decide about the two most important factors -

1.  What is the expected prevalence?
2.  What is the 95% confidence interval that will be useful/acceptable?

**Researcher:**The prevalence of smoking among men has been reported as 20%. It could be slightly higher, say 25% or 30%, in this urban area. I want the total width of the 95% confidence interval to be 5% or less. In other words, a lower limit of 2.5% below the point estimate and an upper limit of 2.5% above the point estimate would be acceptable.

**Statistician:** This information is adequate to calculate sample size. I'll demonstrate the use of OpenEpi to calculate the required sample size.

Click the calculate button at the top after entering the "Anticipated frequency (%)" and the "Confidence limits"

### Example Descriptive Study

In our example, the "Anticipated %" is 25% and "Confidence limits as ..." or "Absolute precision" is 2.5%. Enter 25 and 2.5 in the appropriate boxes and click the "Calculate" button above the grey box.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Try different combinations of the expected prevalence and acceptable difference (absolute precision).
-   What happens to the sample size as the expected prevalence increases if you keep the acceptable difference unchanged?
-   What happens to the sample size as the acceptable difference increases if you keep the expected prevalence unchanged?
-   Can you identify different combinations of expected prevalence and acceptable difference that will require almost the same sample size?  


## Sample size for an analytical study

Analytical studies can be case-control, cohort or cross sectional. The exact steps in calculating the sample sizes for these studies differ but the underlying mechanism is the same - we are trying to identify differences between two groups.

\

We'll start with a conversation between a researcher and a statistician as with the previous example.  

**Researcher:** I would like to expand the smoking prevalence study as a cross sectional analytical study. I suspect that there is some difference in the prevalence of smoking between urban areas and rural areas. I would like to take samples of men from an urban area and a rural area and compare the prevalence. Can you tell me how to calculate the sample size for this study?  
**Statistician:** The sample size will depend on the expected prevalence in the two areas and the difference. In addition, we have to decide on the *significance level* (also called the p-value, usually 0.05 - this means that there is a less than 5% chance that we'll wrongly conclude that the prevalence is different in the two areas, when there is no difference in the prevalence) and *power* (usually 80% - this means that there is 80% chance that we'll be able to conclude that there is difference in the prevalence if there is a difference between the prevalence in the two areas that is as big as we expected).  
**Researcher:** The prevalence of smoking in rural areas is expected to be about 20% and I suspect that the prevalence in the urban area will be 30%. I am happy with the significance levle of 0.05 and power of 80%.  
**Statistician:** This information is adequate to calculate sample size. I'll demonstrate the use of OpenEpi to calculate the required sample size. Click on this link and access OpenEpi in your browser.
